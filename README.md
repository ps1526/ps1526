## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav, a student at UCSD studying Data Science. 

I'm currently a **Ledell Scholar**, working with Prof. Justin Eldridge on **large scale knowledge graph embeddings** and **GNN-LLM Hybrid Model Architectures**.

My research interests are knowledge graphs, knowledge injection into large language models, hallucination mitigation, large scale graph learning, and deep learning based graph embeddings.
I also have experience with software and data engineering, working on a variety of projects. 

Additionally, I am currently working as a:

**Research Intern** @ National Nanotechnology Coordination Office

**Researcher** @ UCSD Chiba Lab

**Machine Learning Engineer** @ MimansaPlay
