## Hey there 👋

I'm Pranav, a student at UCSD studying Data Science. 

I'm currently working on research related to geometric deep learning, graph neural networks, and non-Euclidean foundation models, as well as how we as humans learn from our environemnt. 

Some of the current projects I am working on include 
- Reinforcement Learning for Hierarchical Clustering + Neural Algorithmic Reasoning 
- Hyperbolic RAG pipelines for document retrieval
- Audio pipelines for stress detection and speaker seaparation

Previously, I was a 
- **Ledell Scholar**, working with Prof. Justin Eldridge on **large scale knowledge graph embeddings** and **GNN-LLM Hybrid Model Architectures**
- **Research Intern** @ National Nanotechnology Coordination Office
- **Machine Learning Engineer Intern** @ MimansaPlay
